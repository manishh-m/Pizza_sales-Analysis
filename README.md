__Business Problem__
-------
To handle the huge amount of data (about 50k rows of data combined), a pizza company needs an effective and scalable data analytics solution toÂ analyze and extract meaningful insights such as trends, order patterns, menu performance, customer preferences, and other critical business metrics. In addition to identifying trends and insights, visualizations must be made for sales by pizza type and size, top/bottom sellers, and daily and monthly order volume. The goal is to provide the company with data-driven insights that guide strategic choices and boost productivity and profitability.

__Solution Plan__
-------
+ We will use Power BI's data visualization capabilities and SQL to extract relevant information and carry out insightful analyses to assist the pizza company in gaining important insights from their sales data CSV file.
+ We can find important metrics like total revenue, average order size, and best/worst selling menu items by utilizing SQL's functions. After the data has been prepared and extracted, we will use Power BI to create interactive visualizations that show the results. 
+ we intend to create a dynamic Power BI dashboard that allows users to view daily order volume and sales data by pizza type/size. The ultimate goal is to provide the business with data-driven insights to inform strategic decisions that improve operations and profitability.
